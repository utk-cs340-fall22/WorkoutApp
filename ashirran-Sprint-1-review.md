### What you accomplished
I first created the skelton website. Then I created the "Main" Web app in the website. Next, I added the path to the web app in the urls.py file. After that, I created the template file and created the CreateAccount.html, SignIn.html, and homepage.html files. Then I added the paths to all our pages on the urls.py file. Next, I created the views section. Then in the views file I defined home(request), CreateAccount(request), SignIn(request), SignOut(request), CreateCharts(request), ChartHistory(request) and MoreInfo(request). I then made it to where a user could create an account, sign in and sign out. For the last three I just made them pass because I was not implementing those pages. Next I created the html files for home, CreateAccount, SignIn, SignOut. Then I added all the basic buttons and forms to make the website pages accessable.
