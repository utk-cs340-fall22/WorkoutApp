# Sprint 1

Name: Jacob Howard

Github ID: jhowar63

Group Name: WorkoutApp

### What you planned to do
- Become familiar with the tools that we will be using for the project. https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/16
- Create a Workout Editor Page. https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/17
- Create backend Exercises, Workouts, and Workout History. https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/18
- Create a Workout Library. https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/19

### What you did not do
- I was able to learn how to create and reference instances of models on Django, so I was not able to start utilizing backend data structures for exercises and workouts.
- We decided to wait on implementing a workout library until we were completely comfortable and finished with the model linking. So I did not work on issue 19.

### What problems you encountered
- It took me much longer to be comfortable with Django/Python/HTML than I had originally expected. It meant that I was not confident in pushing code till later in the sprint than I had hoped.
- Justin, Michael, and I spent a long time trying to figure out how to save text entered into a variable that can be stored and then referenced. We have yet to find a permanent solution.

### What you accomplished

I learned a lot this sprint.I began with learning how to navigate the vscode code editor, this is my first time working with it. I then spent time learning Django, how to install it, set up a virtual environment to run it, and basic functionality. I also got more comfortable with python and html.
Once I was ready to start contributing code to the project, I created CreateWorkout.html, which is the workout editor page, and linked it to our website skeleton. I then created the Exercise, Workout, and WorkoutHistory modules. I migrated those modules as well as the “Main” app into the project website. I then spent the rest of the time working on linking individual exercises to a workout.
