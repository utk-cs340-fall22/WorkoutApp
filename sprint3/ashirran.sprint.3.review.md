### What you accomplished
First I relooked at our last sprint. Then I read through everyones code to get myself up to date on how everything is working. After that, I fixed our pictures on the homescreen and fixed a few minor bugs. Next, I looked into how drop down menus worked and fixed our forms for adding exercises to incorperate the drop down menu. Next, I implemented the delete system for both individual exercises and for entire workouts. After I made sure everything was working properly, I then started with my final issue. I started building the calorie calculator and had quite a bit of back end issues and it took me such a long time to fix all of the back end issues that I had to stop there and chose to pick up with the front end of the calorie calculator on the next sprint.
