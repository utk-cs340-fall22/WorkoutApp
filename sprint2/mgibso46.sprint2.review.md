### Files you worked on
- WorkoutApp/Main/urls.py : Added path for CreateWorkout2
- WorkoutApp/Main/views.py : Added CreateWorkout2, Helped with CreateExercercise changes
- WorkoutApp/Templates/CreateExercise.html : Created and standardized
- WorkoutApp/Templates/MoreInfo.html : Fixed a bug where it assumed user was signed in
- WorkoutApp/Templates/CreateWorkout.html : Made it a little cleaner

### What you accomplished
I successfully seperated CreateExercise from CreateWorkout, so now that they are two seperate values being posted. I helped brainstorm with Justin B to help as
much as I could with creating the forms for Workout and Exercise. Fixed a few bugs and made some quality of life changes. Been taking time to learn python on own
time. I helped with Justin in saving the Exercises and Workouts to each user.
