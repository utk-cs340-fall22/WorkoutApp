WorkoutApp

### What you planned to do
* Expand models.py to support workout data[#34](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/34)
* Create forms.py that collect user input[#36](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/36)
* Turn the user input into data associated with their profile[#35](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/35)

### What you did not do
* Did not get the workout/exercise adding feature as fluid as I wanted
* Not enough error checking and data validation

### What problems you encountered
* The biggest challenge was setting up the forms
* Once the forms were made, it was difficult to link them to models
* I had trouble laying out the webpages exactly as I had envisioned

### Issues you worked on

* Create forms.py that collect user input[#36](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/36)
