### What you planned to do
* Further improve the cosmetics of the page and body of the page[#37](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/37)
* Begin work on displaying workout Data as a graph[#38](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/38)
* Add scrolling image display to homepage [#39](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/39)



### What you did not do
* I did not begin work on displaying the workouts as a graph, other team members did a good job getting workout history to display. I will implement graphing soon.
* I also didn't add a large amount of body text to the home page, still needs a list of features.


### What problems you encountered
* I've been extremely busy this week due to family and car complications
* The image scroller I have created is too big/intrusive, I will need to change the css values to make it fit the page better.
* I cannot figure out how to remove the white boxes on the buttons in the floating nav bar.
