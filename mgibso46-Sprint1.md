### Files you worked on
- WorkoutApp/Main/urls.py : Added paths needed for ProfilePage/CreateExercise
- WorkoutApp/Main/views.py : Fixed bugs, added ProfilePage and CreateExercise
- WorkoutApp/Templates/homepage.html : Removed the signed in page, seperated it to different page (ProfilePage.html)
- WorkoutApp/Templates/ProfilePage.html : Created to come up when signing in. 
- WorkoutApp/Template/CreateWorkout.html : Created a working button to save the exercise given from input. Also fixed cancel button

### What you accomplished
I seperated the homepage into two seperate pages, one for when you are signed out (Current homepage.html) and one for when you are logged in (ProfilePage.html). 
adjusted values in the profile page to be more aligned with what we were looking for. I also helped figure out how to create a working button in the createWorkout
page that actively stored an exercise saved. I also fixed a few bugs.
