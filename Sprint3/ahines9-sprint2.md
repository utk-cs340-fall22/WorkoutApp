### What you did not do
* Display previous workouts as a graph

### What problems you encountered
* When I began to implement Bootstrap the first thing I had to do was learn how to use it. This posed a slight challenge for me as I kept finding documentation for previous builds of bootstrap(3,4,and 5) and the class names were different in each version. This made it difficult to track down documentation for the version of bootstrap we were using.
* Once implemented, bootstrap made the floating navigation bar and scrolling image display I had created no longer work, so I had to reimplement them using bootstrap.
* I became ill on Tuesday with a fever and migraine and was unable to finalize and push my commits before class on Thursday morning. I also was not able to attend class this Thursday for that reason. However, I have it completed now.
