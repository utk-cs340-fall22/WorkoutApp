### What you planned to do
- Make the website look tidier and easier to use
- Add QOL features to the website
- Work on the backend for calorie tracking

### What you did not do
- Wasn't able to help with the backend for calorie tracking.


### What problems you encountered
  - Made a whole new page to confirm a deletion, would rather have the confirm on same page

### Issues you worked on
- QOL features: https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/33
- Create confirmation for deleting items : https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/45

### What you accomplished
I made some bug fixes and qol changes, since the past 2 weeks have been quite lack luster in availability of time. I added a confirmation button for whenever
someone tries to delete a workout button to make sure they want to delete it. I changed the Add workout to New Workout. I fixed a bug where being on certain pages,
pressing profile page would send you to homepage instead.
