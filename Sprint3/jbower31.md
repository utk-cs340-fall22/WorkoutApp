### What you planned to do
* Use data to make graphs of user's wokrout history[#38](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/38)
* Search for and patch bugs in website[#48](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/48)
* Clean up messy code in directories[#46](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/46)

### What you did not do
* Did not get graphs fully implemented
* Did not get around to testing for as many bugs as I would like

### What problems you encountered
* The main issue was with the data visualization library I attemtped to use first
* Implementing graphs with matplotlib was not very intuitive, messy, and mostly nonfunctional
* Now will be doing this feature with plotly
