### What you planned to do
- Create Graphs that display the user's Workout History using Plotly.
- Create a Navigation bar that can be added to every page. https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/55 
- Add the new navigation bar to all pages on the website. https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/56 
- Clean up the website, making it more professional and finalized. https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/57 

### What you did not do
- This sprint I did not end up working on graphs this sprint. Justin did a great job with it so I instead focused primarily on the beautification of the website.

### What problems you encountered
- I ended up having a lot of difficulty implementing drop downs on the side navigation bar.
This was because I was trying to keep a side and top nav bar that were conflicting with each other.

### Issues you worked on
- Create a default Navigation Bar. https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/55 
- Add the new side navigation bar to all pages on the website. https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/56 
- Clean up the main content of pages on the website. https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/WorkoutApp/issues/57

### What you accomplished
This sprint I was focused primarily on the front end, specifically making the website more visually pleasing. To do so I applied a bootstrap theme, creating and integrating a useful and interactive navigation bar. Then I added this new default side navigation bar to all pages of the website, as I was doing so I tidied up the pages so that they are properly spaced and displays the respective information in an organized and efficient way.
