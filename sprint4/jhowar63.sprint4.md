### What you accomplished.

This sprint I was focused primarily on the front end, specifically making the website more visually pleasing. To do so I applied a bootstrap theme, creating and integrating a useful and interactive navigation bar. Then I added this new default side navigation bar to all pages of the website, as I was doing so I tidied up the pages so that they are properly spaced and displays the respective information in an organized and efficient way.
