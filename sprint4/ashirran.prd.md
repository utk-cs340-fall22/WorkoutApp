## Background
Monthly subscriptions are everywhere these days, and the health and fitness industry is no exception. Being able to track your day to day workouts and eating routines can be
difficult with all of those subscriptions. Well fear no longer, introducing: Workout App. Workout App is a web application that helps you track your day to day workout routines 
as well as the calorie, carb, fat, protein and calorie intake that is in the meals you consume. Workout App allows the user to track all of their information as well as document
everything in charts and graphs. Our app will use ad revenue as well as data collection to gather resources to keep the site running. The sole purpose of the ads and data 
collection is to be able to keep the site paying for itself while also giving customers a free and smooth experience on our site.

## Project Overview
WorkoutApp is a web application built with Django that allows users to log and analyze their workouts and meals. There are multiple places you can visit on the site: Homepage,
Create new workout, Create new meal, Profile page, Sign in/out, Create Account, and More info. Homepage is simply the basic homepage which provides the user with information 
about the app and it scrolls through different fitness pictures. Create new workout allows the user to create a workout by entering the day the workout was done. Create new 
meal works the same as the create new workout page but adds a meal instead. Profile page has many options to choose from. You are able to change your account information using 
the Edit Profile button. You can also use the chart under the Edit Profile button to see how you are doing with your workouts. Below that, there is a history of workouts and 
meals listed by date, which you can click individually to add exercises/meal into them. When you add an Exercise, you must input the exercise name, set amount, rep amount, weight,
and RPE. Once added, you can add another exercise to the same workout, or go back to the profile page. Doing this will adjust the plot to show you more information on how you are 
doing. You can also delete exercises and workouts, however workouts require extra confirmation. Sign in and sign out simply does as it is stated: signs the user in and out of the
website. Create account allows the user to create an account with a unique username, email and password. Finally, the more info page allows the user to visit different links with
information to learn more about different workouts and diets other people do.
