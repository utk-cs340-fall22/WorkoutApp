# Product Requirements Document
Name: Jacob Howard

Product Name: Workout App

## Background
Explain the user need or market opportunity

## Project Overview
Describe the proposed project. You can use the same description that your group uses in the final project README.md. The rest should be your own work,
but the project overview can be the same for everyone in the group.

## Features
Give at least 8 user stories to describe required features. These can come from the issues assigned to you during the 4 sprints, or you 
can create new items. Give a title or feature name for each story. Example: 
1. **Account holder withdraws cash.** As a customer,	I want to withdraw cash from an ATM,	so that I donâ€™t have to wait in line at the bank.
2. **Create Account.** As a new user, I want to register by creating a username and password so that the system can remember me and my data

## Technologies to be used
Describe any tools and technologies to be used in the project. Include the languages, third-party libraries, and tools that will be used.
