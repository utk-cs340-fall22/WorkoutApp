## What I accomplished

This sprint, I did not do much code, as I was completely focused on our presentation and licensing.
I created the presentation slides for our presentation, as well the script we plan on using, including
deciding who will work on which parts. I also started working on the licensing needed for our 
project, and created the majority of the readme.md we have currently. I also filled up homepage
with information, and fixed a bug in ProfilePage where protein was not showing with meals.
