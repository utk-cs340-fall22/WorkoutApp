# Product Requirements Document

Name: Michael Gibson

Product Name: WorkoutApp

## Background
Almost everyone works out. They go to the gym, or workout at home. Sometimes it is hard to tell what if you improving though, so having something
to help show how you have been doing would be very useful. That is what are app plans to do. Most apps have to be paid for, or have to pay a monthly 
fee. We plan to not have any payments within our App.

## Project Overview
WorkoutApp is a web application built with Django that allows users to log and analyze their workouts and meals. It uses these workouts and meals to create
a graph to show your progression through time. Each workout can be customize with many different exercises, so that a user can personalize them and 
keep track of them easily. They can also keep track of their meals, adjusting them accordingly. The app uses these meals to display what type of 
calories the user usually eats.
