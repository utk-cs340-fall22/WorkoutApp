# What I Accomplished

During this sprint I was able to finish all of the front and back end details for our calorie tracker as well as edit a few bugs and minor things that needed changed. Our calorie tracker now has the ability to add and delete indvividual meals and dates along with them. It also has the ability to read and store the data provided by the user. I really enjoying getting to learn about django and html and I will definitly be using this on my own in future classes, jobs and recreation. I was able to learn how to code the front and back end proccesses of a website and that is a big acomplishment for me. I will enjoy getting to add this project to my resume.
