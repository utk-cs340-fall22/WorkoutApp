## Background

The fitness industry has been growing rapidly in recent years and with its increasing popularity there is also a growing demand for tools that individuals can utilize to pursue their fitness goals efficiently. 
Tracking workout and diet information is an essential part of an individual fitness pursuit no matter the context. 

Thus an application that meets both of those needs and supplies a user with their relevant past information in a visually appealing way would be extremely well received by the market.

## Project Overview

WorkoutApp is an online workout and diet tool built with Django that allows users to track their workout and diet history. 
WorkoutApp stores user entered workouts that consist of a collection of exercises as well as information regarding meals throughout a day to compose a user’s individual workout and diet histories.
The user is able to edit these histories as well as information regarding their account on WorkoutApp to make changes at any point when necessary. 

WorkoutApp then utilizes the users workout history and meal information to create graphical representations of the user’s information so that they can easily interpret their fitness information. 
WorkoutApp does all of this within a very uniform, visually appealing, and easily navigated user web interface. 
At the core of this user interface is the side navigation bar that displays appropriate information for the specific user as they navigate the site.
