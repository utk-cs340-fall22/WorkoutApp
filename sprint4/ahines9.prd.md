Product Name: Workout App

## Background
Explain the user need or market opportunity

## Project Overview
WorkoutApp is a web application built with Django that allows users to log and analyze their workouts and meals using an account. It also provides additional info
on workout and nutrition.

## Features
1. **Create Account** As a new user, I want my workout data to be saved seperately from anyone else using the site, that way I can easily track my own progress.
2. **Log Workout** As a user of the site, I want to be able to log my workouts, including sets, reps, and weight.
3. **Log Meals** Nutrition is a very important part of fitness, I want to be able to log my meals including information such as how many grams of Carbs, Protein, and Fat.
4. **Additional Information** As a new user to Workout App and being new to fitness in general, I want to be able to access more resources that can help provide information about diet and exercise.
5. **Display Workouts** Once I log my workouts I want to be able to view them and track my progress, a graph makes it very easy to visualize my data and progress.
6. **Display Nutrition** I want an easy way to display my nutrition information as well. A pie chart showing the distributions of Carbs Protein and Fat makes it easy to view.
7. **Configurable Account** As a user of any site, I want to be able to edit my information(email, passwords, etc) after creating an account.

HTML- HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) is a coding language that is used for webpages, it determines the contents and structure of the site.
CSS- CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that is often included in HTML documents in order to change the visuals of the page(font, indention, text size, and other cosmetics)
Python- Python is a general programming language that we use for the backend of our site, python is used for the Django, Plotly, and matplotlib libraries.
Django- Django is a python web framework that we use to host our site locally, it deals with user accounts, and uses SQLite for the database so we can store the account, workout, and meal data.
Google Api- Google API templates can be included in HTML pages to style the CSS and add tools, navbars, etc.
plotly- Plotly is a graphing library for python that can display data as a graph.
matplotlib- Matplotlib is also a graphing library, it also displays graphs, and allows the viewer to navigate it. It allows the user to zoom, pan, set the range of the graph,
or save the current graph view as a png file.
