# What I Accomplished

My goal for this project was to create a useful application while gaining some skills with backend development, data
visualization, and Python. With this in mine I feel that I succeded. In terms of the project itself, I think much more could have
been done had there not been so many learning curves involved, but that was great for me as a developer. I feel more comfortable with Python now, I learned some basics of some new libraries (plotly, pandas, django), and utilized SQLite to create a basic backend for a project. Along with these skills came learning how to work with a team. This was my first team project, and I feel like my communication with the team was solid and that we worked out a workflow together quite well.
